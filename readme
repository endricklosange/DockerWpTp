# WordPress Project in Docker - User Guide

Welcome to your WordPress project in Docker! This guide will help you set up and run your WordPress site locally using Docker.

## Configuration Steps

1. Create a `.env` file based on the structure of the provided `.env.sample` file. Make sure the following variables have the same value:

   - `WORDPRESS_DB_USER`
   - `MYSQL_USER`
   - `PMADB_USER`
   - `PMA_USER`

   Similarly, ensure that the following variables have the same value:

   - `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD`
   - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
   - `PMADB_PASS`
   - `PMA_PASSWORD`

   This will ensure that WordPress, MySQL database, and phpMyAdmin share the same credentials.

## Starting the Container

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory of your project containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Run the following command to start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start the WordPress, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin containers based on the configuration defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. Once the containers are running, you can access your WordPress site by opening your web browser and going to the following URL:

   http://localhost:8080

   You can now configure WordPress according to your needs.

## Accessing phpMyAdmin

5. To access phpMyAdmin and manage your database, open your web browser and go to the following URL:

   http://localhost:8000

   You can log in to phpMyAdmin using the same credentials you set in the `.env` file.

That's it! You now have a locally running WordPress development environment thanks to Docker. Feel free to customize your WordPress site and manage your database via phpMyAdmin to create the website of your dreams.
